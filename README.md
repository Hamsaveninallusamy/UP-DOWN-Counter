# UP-DOWN-Counter
This project implements a digital up/down counter using a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32) or a programmable logic device like an FPGA. The counter can increment or decrement its value based on user input, such as button presses or external signals. It features real-time updates displayed on an output interface, like an LED segment display, LCD, or OLED. The direction of counting (up or down) is controlled using dedicated buttons or switches. The design can be extended to include features like reset functionality, adjustable count limits, and memory to retain the count during power loss. This counter is ideal for learning digital electronics and microcontroller programming, with applications in automation, robotics, and monitoring systems.
